      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My name is Gabriel Ikpaetuk. I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying 
        Computer Engineering. I have an amazing idea for a website to help people learn how about 
        the exciting aspects of Nigeria. On the website, there will be sections designed to help 
        build and expand peoplesâ€™ knowledge of the language, culture, and history of Nigeria. 
        In addition, there will be an option to explore Nigeria via a picture gallery section. 
        Rather than just telling the unique story of Nigeria and its people, the website will 
        provide a meaningful visual experience to visitors.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target audiences are adult women and men, youth groups, families, and college students, 
        from different places and backgrounds around the world, spanning different businesses and 
        cultures. 

        In general any person or set of people who are seeking to be on an adventure to learn about the 
        culture, languages, people, and history of Nigeria. For people who consider learning international 
        history and expanding their knowledge of western African culture, the website will provide exciting 
        facts and knowledge bits in making sure their yearning is served well. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <p>
        Nigeria is a country on Africa's western coast. Nigeria's topography is diverse, 
        with climates ranging from dry to humid tropical. The people of Nigeria, on the other hand, 
        are the most diversified feature of the country. Yoruba, Igbo, Fula, Hausa, Edo, Ibibio, Tiv, and English 
        are among the hundreds of languages spoken in the country. The country boasts an abundance of 
        natural resources, most notably vast amounts of petroleum and natural gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The national capital is Abuja, which is located in the Federal Capital Territory, which 
        was established by decree in 1976. Lagos, the historic capital, continues to be the country's 
        most important commercial and industrial center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nigeria as we know it now stems from 1914, when the British Protectorates of Northern and 
        Southern Nigeria merged. The country gained independence on October 1, 1960, and in 
        1963 adopted a republican constitution while remaining a Commonwealth member.

      <h3>Land</h3>
      <p>
        RELIEF
      </p>
      <p>
        Nigeria's terrain is characterized by lowlands in the north and south, which are interrupted 
        by plateaus and hills in the center of the country. The Sokoto Plains are located in the 
        country's northwest region, while the Borno Plains are located in the country's northeastern
        corner and extend all the way to the Lake Chad basin. Soft, geologically young sedimentary strata 
        underpin the Lake Chad basin and coastal areas, including the Niger River delta and western parts
        of the Sokoto region in the extreme northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLIMATE
      </p>
      <p>
        The climate of Nigeria is tropical. The country is located in the southern part of the Saharan desert, 
        and as such, experiences two seasons throughout the year. The seasons are divided by the 
        harmattan season, which is the transition period between the wet and dry seasons.
        The wet or rainy season lasts from April to October. During this time, the country 
        experiences a lot of rainfall and there is a lot of humidity. At this time, temperatures 
        are at their highest, and there is a lot of cloud cover.
        The dry or harmattan season lasts from November to March. The harmattan season is 
        characterized by a dry and dusty wind. Temperatures during this time are at their lowest, and 
        there is very little rainfall and cloud cover.
        The climate of Nigeria is also affected by the Atlantic Ocean, which borders the country to the 
        south. The ocean creates a coastal climate along the southern coast of Nigeria. This climate is 
        characterized by warm temperatures and a lot of humidity.
        The climate of Nigeria is mostly tropical, with little variation in temperature throughout the year.

      <p>
        ETHNIC GROUPS
      </p>
      <p>
        Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups. Each inhabits a region that it regards as its 
        own by right of original occupancy and inheritance. Individuals who are not members of a 
        dominant group but have lived and worked in the group's territory for several decades are 
        nevertheless considered aliens. Although such foreigners may not have outright title to 
        land in most rural areas, a significant number of people have traveled from one ethnic 
        territory to another in quest of farmland. The country is divided into three primary 
        ethnic groups: Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo.
      </p>
      <p>LANGUAGES</p>
      <p>
        In Nigeria, around 525 indigenous languages are spoken. English, the language of 
        former colonial British Nigeria, is the official language of Nigeria.
        Nigerian languages are divided into three large linguistic groups: Niger-Congo, 
        Nilo-Saharan, and Afro-Asian.
