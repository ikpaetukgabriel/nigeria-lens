              Nigeria's terrain is characterized by lowlands in the north and south, 
              which are interrupted by plateaus and hills in the center of the country. 
              The Sokoto Plains are located in the country's northwest region, while the Borno 
              Plains are located in the country's northeastern corner and extend all the way to 
              the Lake Chad basin. Soft, geologically young sedimentary strata underpin the Lake Chad 
              basin and coastal areas, including the Niger River delta and western parts of 
              the Sokoto region in the extreme northwest.

              The climate of Nigeria is tropical. The country is located in the southern part of the 
              Saharan desert, and as such, experiences two seasons throughout the year. The seasons are 
              divided by the harmattan season, which is the transition period between the wet and dry seasons. 
              The wet or rainy season lasts from April to October. During this time, the country experiences a 
              lot of rainfall and there is a lot of humidity. At this time, temperatures are at their highest, 
              and there is a lot of cloud cover. The dry or harmattan season lasts from November to March. The 
              harmattan season is characterized by a dry and dusty wind. Temperatures during this time are at their 
              lowest, and there is very little rainfall and cloud cover. The climate of Nigeria is mostly tropical, 
              with little variation in temperature throughout the year.
